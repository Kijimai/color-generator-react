#### Values JS

## Package used

[values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js)

## How it works

The user types in a color value and the app will generate a range of colors with given hex value and rgb. It accepts color names, as well as hex values starting with a '#'. The colors are split by different ranges (by default set to 10) and the user can change the split range and will see the effect whenever they change the split value.

The colors can also be copied by clicking on the specific color.
